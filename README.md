# Student Performance Data Analysis

  Inferential statistics are involved with producing inferences based on relationships found
in the sample, to relationships in the population. Inferential statistics help us decide, for instance,
whether the distinctions in the middle of groups that we see in our data are powerful and strong
enough to provide support or claim for our hypothesis that group differences exist in common, in
the whole population. In this Project 2 for Probability and Statistical Data Analysis course, we
will implement all the necessary items we learned previously in making a conclusion. The
conclusion that is to be made must adhere to several procedures such as producing a hypothesis
statement, testing the hypothesis using appropriate methods and finalizing a decision. As a result,
we gathered a set of data on student performance in Math and Portuguese in secondary school in
order to conduct some analysis and draw conclusions based on our chosen dataset. This dataset
was retrieved from a https://www.kaggle.com/code/devansodariya/student-performance-analytics
website which was uploaded by Dev Ansodariya, who is a student at L.D. College of
Engineering Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. This data gathered a lot of interesting features like
social, gender and study information about students. This includes the number of school
absences, student’s guardian, weekly study time, home-to-school travel time and so on.

  
   In this era, we can see many reasons that can affect a student's performance in school. For
instance, a student will perform if they spend a lot of time studying. Everyone has their own
reasons and behaviours that affect their performance in school. That’s why this data exists. The
thing that we are interested in this question is whether we can decide and make suggestions for
the situation of students who perform in their course subject. This question allows us to draw
conclusions based on the analysis. It is in that way fundamentally different from descriptive
statistics which merely summarize the data that has actually been measured. Can we find out the
evidence of students performing more in their second period rather than a first period?
Furthermore, in this data set, we expect to find out what factors make the students perform well
in Math or Portuguese
